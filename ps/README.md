# Powershell Scripts

Note to self: Use [Visual Studio Code][1] to edit Powershell scripts.

Can also use the extension to autoformat files as described in [this tutorial][2]

To run the scripts you may need to first execute the command below. (More information on execution policy [in the official docs][3]).

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
